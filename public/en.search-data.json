It’s all about figuring out who or what you need to protect yourself from and what you’re willing to do to keep your information safe. But here’s the catch: the more privacy and security you want, the more inconvenient things can get. You might find yourself juggling extra steps, using complex tools, or changing your habits. It’s a balancing act—finding the right mix of security that keeps you safe without making your life too complicated.\nDeveloping Your Threat Model To create an effective threat model, start by asking yourself the following questions:\n1. What do I want to protect?\nIdentify the assets that are most important to you. This could include personal data, financial information, intellectual property, or even your online reputation.\n2. Who do I want to protect it from?\nConsider the potential adversaries. Are you concerned about cybercriminals, government surveillance, insider threats, or even unintentional breaches by friends or family?\n3. How likely is it that I will need to protect it?\nAssess the likelihood of encountering these threats. Are you a high-profile individual, or do you engage in activities that might attract unwanted attention?\n4. How severe are the consequences if I fail?\nEvaluate the potential impact of a security breach. Would it result in financial loss, reputational damage, or legal repercussions? Understanding the stakes can help prioritize your efforts.\n5. What lengths am I willing to go to prevent potential consequences?\nDetermine your comfort level with various security measures. Are you willing to invest in advanced security tools, adopt strict privacy practices, or change your online behavior?\nI have a threat model. Now what? Now that you have your threat model, it’s time to decide how far you want to go on the Beginner Privacy roadmap. Here are a few profiles to help guide your choice:\nThe Casual User: If your main concern is simply hiding your personal information from big corporations and mass surveillance, the Basic roadmap is all you need.\nThe Privacy-Conscious Individual: If you want to take your privacy more seriously and go beyond the basics to shield yourself from potential threats, you should continue to the Medium roadmap after completing the Basic roadmap.\nThe Activist or High-Risk Individual: If you’re an activist, a journalist, or someone who is wanted by the government, or if you simply want to ensure the highest level of privacy, you should follow the Advanced roadmap after completing both the Basic and Medium roadmaps.\nRegularly Updating Your Threat Model Your threat model isn’t a one-and-done task; it’s something that should evolve as your life and circumstances change. To keep it relevant, consider setting a schedule to review your threat model regularly. This is especially important after significant life events, such as starting a new job, moving to a different location, or making changes to your online presence."},"title":"How To Find A Threat Model That Suits You"},"/articles/limit-the-personal-information-you-share-online/":{"data":{"":"","#":"Are you tired of endless spam emails, robocalls, or discovering your personal data was sold to shady data brokers? Every time you hand over your real name, email, or phone number to a random app or website, you’re gambling with your privacy. To avoid this you’ll have to provide fake information.\nWhen Not To Use Fake Information It’s important to know when you should use fake information and when you should not, as it can quickly backfire.\nLong Term Use Accounts: Don’t use a temporary email when signing up for accounts that you plan to use more than 1 time. Buying things online: You should provide a real address if you’re getting your package delivered to your house. If you are picking up a package at a post office, you should consider using your real name, as they sometime require you to show ID. Other: Please consider the following two things each time before you provide fake information: Is this service or account important to my life? Will I get in trouble if I provide fake information? Fake Information Not every website or form deserves your honesty. For non-critical accounts, use fabricated details:\nFake names: Use a pseudonym like “Alex Smith” instead of your real name. Fake birthdays: Pick a random date (e.g., January 1, 1985). Fake addresses: Use a random address (e.g., a library or coffee shop). Temporary Email Why risk getting spammed on your primary email? Use a burner email for one-time signups or sketchy downloads.\nTemp Mail Popular temporary mail provider\nVisit Website smail Open-source and can be self-hosted\nVisit Website Temporary Phone Number The same goes for phone numbers.

Fortunately for you it’s very easy to switch to a privacy focused search engine.\nHow Does A Search Engine Work? 1. Crawlers Scout the Web\nThink of these bots as digital librarians, constantly scanning and cataloging websites.\n2. Indexing the Internet\nAll crawled pages get stored in a massive database (the “index”), like a library’s card catalog for the web.\n3. Matching Your Query\nWhen you search, the engine scours its index for pages matching your keywords, then ranks them.\nSearch engines like Google show paid “Sponsored” websites at the top. These ads are bought by companies to appear first—they’re not organic results.\nWhy Bother? Traditional search engines like Google or Bing:\nTrack your queries to build a profile of your interests. Sell your data to advertisers or use it to personalize results. Privacy-focused search engines, however:\nDon’t store your searches and tie them to your identity. Serve unbiased results without filtering based on your history.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds a second layer to stop them.\nHow Does 2FA Work? Enter your password. Verify with a second factor A one-time code (app / SMS / email). Biometrics (fingerprint / face scan). A physical security key. Even with your password, hackers can’t access your account without the second factor.\nTypes of 2FA: Which Should You Use? Not all 2FA methods are equally secure.\nSecurity Keys: Best, physical devices (like YubiKey) that plug into your phone or computer.\nAuthenticator Apps: Great, these apps allow you to scan a QR code and then generate time-sensitive codes completely offline.\nSMS / Email Codes: Convenient, but hackers can intercept these via SIM-swapping or phishing.\nBiometrics: Good, fingerprint or face scans are secure but only work on devices you own.\nHow to Enable 2FA on Your Accounts Most platforms make it easy. Here’s how to do it on some platforms:\nGoogle: Security → 2-Step Verification → Get Started. Apple ID: Settings → [Your Name] → Password \u0026 Security.

It reduces tracking, safeguards your personal information, and minimizes your digital footprint while you browse.\nDifference Between Browser And Search Engine To understand the importance of a private browser, it’s essential to differentiate between a browser and a search engine. A browser is a software application that allows users to access and view websites on the internet, while a search engine is a tool that helps users find specific information by searching through indexed web content based on keywords or phrases. In essence, the browser is the interface for navigating the web, and the search engine is a resource for discovering web content.\nWhat Does Websites Know About You Websites can gather a lot of information from your browser, which is why using a privacy-focused browser is essential for protecting your personal data. When you visit a website, it can track various details, including:\nIP Address: This can reveal your approximate location. Browser Type and Version: Websites can identify the browser you are using, which can be used to tailor content or track user behavior. Operating System: Information about your device can be collected, which can also be used for tracking. Cookies: These small files store information about your preferences and browsing history, allowing websites to recognize you on future visits. Tracking Scripts: Many websites use third-party scripts to track user behavior across the web. To see what other information websites can see about you, you can use websites like Webkay, BrowserLeaks, or whoareyou.\nThe Main Types Of Browsers When it comes to choosing a browser, the two main options are Chromium and Firefox. Both are open-source projects, meaning their source code is publicly available for anyone to inspect and contribute to. Most modern browsers are built on either Chromium or Firefox, which means they share similar underlying technologies.\nChromium: This is the open-source project behind Google Chrome and many other browsers. While Chromium itself is privacy-friendly, many browsers built on it may include tracking features or data collection practices. However, there are privacy-focused browsers based on Chromium, such as Brave.\nFirefox: Developed by Mozilla, a nonprofit organization dedicated to an open and private internet, Firefox is known for its strong commitment to user privacy.\nRecommended Private Browsers Brave Chromium based\nVisit Website Mullvad Firefox based\nVisit Website LibreWolf Firefox based\nVisit Website Firefox Focus Firefox based\nVisit Website "},"title":"Why You Need A Private Browser To Protect Yourself"},"/articles/why-you-should-care-about-your-privacy/":{"data":{"":"","#":"In the digital age, an increasing amount of personal data is being collected about us.

From identity theft to government surveillance, it is crucial for everybody to take steps to protect their personal information and maintain their privacy.\n“I have nothing to hide. Why should I care about my privacy?” Just because you have nothing to hide, it doesn’t mean you don’t have anything to protect. Privacy is not just about hiding something, it’s about having control over your personal information and who has access to it. Even if you think you have nothing to hide, your personal information can be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft, phishing scams, and targeted advertising.\n“I don’t have time to worry about my privacy” Protecting your privacy doesn’t have to be time-consuming. There are simple steps you can take to improve your privacy such as using a VPN and being mindful of the personal information you share online.\nUnpredictability Of The Future The unpredictability of the future is a reason to care about your privacy, as personal information can be used in ways that you never imagined.
