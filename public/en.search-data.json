Data Profiling: Telecom companies can profile users by analyzing their messages and logs, often selling this data to third parties without your consent. Getting Others To Use It Transitioning to a secure communication method is only effective if your contacts are on board. Here are some strategies to encourage others to ditch SMS:\nEducate Your Contacts: Share information about the risks associated with SMS and the benefits of secure messaging apps.

Linux isn‚Äôt just for tech wizards‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful, open-source operating system that prioritizes privacy, customization, and stability. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux doesn‚Äôt track your activity or force you into proprietary ecosystems. It‚Äôs free to use, modify, and share, backed by a global community of developers. Whether you‚Äôre a privacy-conscious user, a tinkerer, or someone tired of bloated software, Linux offers a refreshing alternative.\nChoosing Your Linux Distribution With hundreds of distributions (or ‚Äúdistros‚Äù) available, picking the right one can feel overwhelming. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:\nDebian-based distros (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint) are ideal for beginners due to their stability and extensive software libraries. Arch-based distros (e.g., Manjaro) cater to users who want bleeding-edge software and deeper customization. Fedora or openSUSE strike a balance between innovation and reliability. For most newcomers, we recommend Debian‚Äîthe rock-solid foundation for many popular distros. Once you‚Äôve chosen a distro, decide on a desktop environment:\nGNOME: Sleek, modern, and intuitive (similar to macOS). KDE Plasma: Highly customizable with a Windows-like feel. XFCE or LXQt: Lightweight options for older hardware. Getting Comfortable with Linux Before wiping your hard drive, test Linux risk-free in a virtual machine (VM). Tools like VirtualBox let you run Linux alongside your current OS. Here‚Äôs how:\nDownload a Linux ISO (e.g., Debian or Ubuntu). Install VirtualBox and create a new VM, allocating resources like RAM and storage. Boot the VM from the ISO and install it through the ‚ÄúGraphical Install‚Äù option. VirtualBox A free, open-source tool for running OSes in a VM.\nVisit Website Making the Switch: What to Expect Many fear Linux is all about typing commands in a terminal. While the terminal is powerful, modern distros offer user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for everyday tasks like browsing, editing files, or installing software.\nDual Booting: The Best of Both Worlds Need Windows or macOS for specific apps or work? Dual booting lets you keep both Operating Systems on one machine.\nSingle-drive setup: Partition your drive to allocate space for Linux. Multi-drive setup: Install Linux on a separate drive for easier management. ‚ö†Ô∏è Back up your data first! Partitioning carries risks, and mistakes can lead to data loss. Preparing for Installation Before installing Linux, gather these essentials:\nA USB drive (8GB+ recommended) for the installer. An external drive to back up critical files. Installing Debian: Step-by-Step Guide Step 1: Download the Correct Debian ISO Visit Debian‚Äôs download page and select under the ‚ÄúSmall CDs or USB sticks‚Äù header:\namd64: For most 64-bit Intel/AMD systems. arm64: For newer ARM-based devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4). i386: For older 32-bit machines (rare today). Step 2: Create a Bootable USB Install Balena Etcher (download here). Plug in your USB drive, open Etcher, and select the Debian ISO. Click Flash! and wait for the process to complete. Step 3: Boot from the USB Restart your computer and press the BIOS/UEFI key (commonly F2, F12, Del, or Esc). In the boot menu, prioritize the USB drive. Save changes and exit to launch the Debian installer. Step 4: Install Debian Select Graphical Install for a guided setup. Follow prompts for language, location, and user account creation. When it prompts you about Partitioning you have the following options: Guided - use entire disk: Erases the entire disk and installs Debian as the sole operating system. Ideal for new users or dedicated Linux setups.\nGuided - use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM: Installs Debian as the sole OS while enabling full-disk encryption via LVM (Logical Volume Manager). Perfect for securing sensitive data.\nManual: For advanced users: Create, resize, or retain partitions (e.g., dual-boot with Windows). Requires familiarity with disk layouts.\nWhen it prompts you about Software Selection: Choose the desktop environment you want (GNOME or KDE Plasma) and optional tools (e.g., SSH server, print server). Complete the installation and reboot. Linux isn‚Äôt just an OS‚Äîit‚Äôs a gateway to learning, creativity, and control.

It‚Äôs all about figuring out who or what you need to protect yourself from and what you‚Äôre willing to do to keep your information safe. But here‚Äôs the catch: the more privacy and security you want, the more inconvenient things can get. You might find yourself juggling extra steps, using complex tools, or changing your habits. It‚Äôs a balancing act‚Äîfinding the right mix of security that keeps you safe without making your life too complicated.\nDeveloping Your Threat Model To create a threat model, you can take our theat model assessment. Start Threat Model Assessment How sensitive is your typical online activity? Basic web browsing (e.g., reading news, shopping) Some personal communications (e.g., social media, emails) Handling sensitive work documents (e.g., client data, contracts) Activism or whistleblowing (e.g., sharing sensitive information) What's your biggest privacy concern? Targeted ads Mass surveillance Having a digital footprint Being targeted by malicious actors ‚Üê Previous What lengths are you willing to go to protect your privacy? I prefer convenience over security I'll make some effort, but not too much I'm willing to sacrifice a decent amount of convenience for better security and privacy I‚Äôm ready to invest heavily in security and change my lifestyle ‚Üê Previous Your Threat Model: Retake Assessment You can also do it manually by asking yourself the following questions:\n1. What do I want to protect?\nIdentify the assets that are most important to you. This could include personal data, financial information, intellectual property, or even your online reputation.\n2. Who do I want to protect it from?\nConsider the potential adversaries. Are you concerned about cybercriminals, government surveillance, insider threats, or even unintentional breaches by friends or family?\n3. How likely is it that I will need to protect it?\nAssess the likelihood of encountering these threats. Are you a high-profile individual, or do you engage in activities that might attract unwanted attention?\n4. How severe are the consequences if I fail?\nEvaluate the potential impact of a security breach. Would it result in financial loss, reputational damage, or legal repercussions? Understanding the stakes can help prioritize your efforts.\n5. What lengths am I willing to go to prevent potential consequences?\nDetermine your comfort level with various security measures. Are you willing to invest in advanced security tools, adopt strict privacy practices, or change your online behavior?\nI have a threat model. Now what? Now that you have your threat model, it‚Äôs time to decide how far you want to go on the Beginner Privacy roadmap. Here are a few profiles to help guide your choice:\nThe Casual User: If your main concern is simply hiding your personal information from big corporations and mass surveillance, the Basic roadmap is all you need.\nThe Privacy-Conscious Individual: If you want to take your privacy more seriously and go beyond the basics to shield yourself from potential threats, you should continue to the Medium roadmap after completing the Basic roadmap.\nThe Activist or High-Risk Individual: If you‚Äôre an activist, a journalist, or someone who is wanted by the government, or if you simply want to ensure the highest level of privacy, you should follow the Advanced roadmap after completing both the Basic and Medium roadmaps.\nRegularly Updating Your Threat Model Your threat model isn‚Äôt a one-and-done task; it‚Äôs something that should evolve as your life and circumstances change. To keep it relevant, consider setting a schedule to review your threat model regularly. This is especially important after significant life events, such as starting a new job, moving to a different location, or making changes to your online presence."},"title":"How To Find A Threat Model That Suits You"},"/articles/limit-the-personal-information-you-share-online/":{"data":{"":"","#":"Are you tired of endless spam emails, robocalls, or discovering your personal data was sold to shady data brokers?

But how do they actually work, and more importantly, should you use one?\nHow Does A VPN Work? A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure connection between your device and the internet by routing your traffic through a private server. This process encrypts your data, making it impossible for your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to see your online activities. What Does A VPN Protect You From? While a VPN is effective at hiding your IP address, accessing geo-restricted content, and preventing ISP surveillance, it does not protect you from hackers, phishing emails, or other threats.\nHow To Choose A Good VPN When searching for a reliable VPN, trustworthiness is crucial since the service will have access to your online activities. Here are key factors to consider when evaluating a VPN:\nOpen Source: Look for VPNs with open-source code, allowing for transparency and community audits. Minimal Personal Information Required: Choose services that don‚Äôt require sensitive information like your name, phone number, or email. Strict No-Logging Policy: Ensure the VPN has a verified no-logging policy, meaning they do not store your browsing history.

It reduces tracking, safeguards your personal information, and minimizes your digital footprint while you browse.\nDifference Between Browser And Search Engine To understand the importance of a private browser, it‚Äôs essential to differentiate between a browser and a search engine. A browser is a software application that allows users to access and view websites on the internet, while a search engine is a tool that helps users find specific information by searching through indexed web content based on keywords or phrases. In essence, the browser is the interface for navigating the web, and the search engine is a resource for discovering web content.\nWhat Does Websites Know About You Websites can gather a lot of information from your browser, which is why using a privacy-focused browser is essential for protecting your personal data. When you visit a website, it can track various details, including:\nIP Address: This can reveal your approximate location. Browser Type and Version: Websites can identify the browser you are using, which can be used to tailor content or track user behavior. Operating System: Information about your device can be collected, which can also be used for tracking. Cookies: These small files store information about your preferences and browsing history, allowing websites to recognize you on future visits. Tracking Scripts: Many websites use third-party scripts to track user behavior across the web. To see what other information websites can see about you, you can use websites like Webkay, BrowserLeaks, or whoareyou.\nThe Main Types Of Browsers When it comes to choosing a browser, the two main options are Chromium and Firefox. Both are open-source projects, meaning their source code is publicly available for anyone to inspect and contribute to. Most modern browsers are built on either Chromium or Firefox, which means they share similar underlying technologies.\nChromium: This is the open-source project behind Google Chrome and many other browsers. While Chromium itself is privacy-friendly, many browsers built on it may include tracking features or data collection practices.
