Welcome to the Beginner Privacy content guide!

### Getting Started
**Choose your editing method:**
- GitHub Editor: Edit directly in your browser.
- Local Setup (Recommended): [Learn how to setup this website locally.](../setup-locally/)

**Check out what to write:** 

Head over to our [Article Status Board](https://github.com/orgs/beginnerprivacy/projects/1) on GitHub to see what articles haven't been written yet.

### Create Your Article
1. Navigate to the [content/articles/](https://github.com/beginnerprivacy/beginnerprivacy.github.io/tree/main/content/articles) folder.
2. Create a new folder with a URL-friendly name (e.g., `why-privacy-matters` for "Why Privacy Matters").
3. Inside this folder, create three files:
    - **index.md** (English)
    - **index.es.md** (Spanish)
    - **index.zh-cn.md** (Chinese Simplified)

üñºÔ∏è **Need images?**
- Create a matching folder in [static/images/articles/](https://github.com/beginnerprivacy/beginnerprivacy.github.io/tree/main/static/images/articles) (e.g., `why-privacy-matters`).

### Article Template
Include this at the top of your article.

### Writing Style
**Audience:** 

Beginner Privacy's audience consists of adults aged 18 to 50 who possess a foundational understanding of the internet and computers. While avoiding oversimplification, it is important to clarify any jargon used.

**Style:**
- Use American English.
- Be concise while covering key details (e.g., why a tool is recommended).
- Structure content with Markdown headers (`###`).

### Translating Article
Beginner Privacy is available in 3 languages: English, Spanish, and Chinese (Simplified).
1. **Translate** the English version using a tool like [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/) or any other translator you prefer into Spanish and Chinese (Simplified).
2. **Translation Verification:** Translate the article that has already been translated back into English, and then compare it to the original English article to:
    - Catch mistranslated technical terms
    - Verify sentence structure matches the intended meaning
    - Identify missing context
3. **Adjust image paths** for non-English articles:
    - Add `../` to paths (e.g., `../../images/...` ‚Üí `../../../images/...` for the Spanish/Chinese articles).
4. **Proofread:** Fix formatting issues and ensure clarity.

### Markdown & Shortcodes
Explore the Hextra documentation on [Markdown](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/guide/markdown/) and [Shortcodes](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/guide/shortcodes/) to enhance your articles, making them more interactive and easier to read. Additionally, Beginner Privacy offers several custom shortcodes, which are detailed below
