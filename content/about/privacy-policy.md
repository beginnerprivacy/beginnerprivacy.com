**TL;DR** 

We collect almost nothing. No IP addresses, no cookies, no logs. The only data stored is your roadmap progress (saved locally on your device) and basic page view stats (with no personal info). Everything else is deliberately NOT collected to protect your privacy.

### What we do collect
We've built this site using the simplest possible tools to ensure maximum privacy:
- ✅ **Lightweight Framework:** Our website is built on a minimal framework that we have thoroughly audited to eliminate hidden tracking or logging.
- ✅ **Anonymous Usage Data:** We collect a small amount of anonymous data to understand how users interact with our site. You can view these statistics on [GoatCounter](https://beginnerprivacy.goatcounter.com).
- ✅ **Roadmap Progress:** The only data stored on your device is your roadmap progress, which is kept in your browser's local storage and never shared.

### How To Disable Tracking By GoatCounter
If you prefer not to be included in GoatCounter statistics, you can easily block tracking by installing the [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) extension in your browser.

### Have Questions?
If you have questions about our privacy practices or need to verify any of our claims, our entire website's code is open source and available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/BeginnerPrivacy). We encourage you to inspect it yourself or have a trusted technical advisor review it.
