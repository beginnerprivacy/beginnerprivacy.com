**TL;DR**

We prioritize your privacy and collect minimal data. We do not log IP addresses, store cookies, or maintain logs. The only information we keep is your roadmap and checklist progress (saved locally on your device) and basic page view statistics (without any personal information). Everything else is intentionally NOT collected to safeguard your privacy.

### What We Do NOT Collect  
Our site is designed with your privacy as a top priority:  
- ❌ **No IP Addresses:** We do not log your IP address.  
- ❌ **No Cookies:** We do not store cookies on your device.  
- ❌ **No Third-Party Services:** We do not load any external services or third-party libraries that could compromise your personal information.  
- ❌ **No Personal Data:** Your personal information is never collected or transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers.  
- ❌ **Roadmap and Checklist Progress:** Your progress is stored locally on your device in your browser's local storage and is never shared.  

### What We Do Collect
We have built this site using the simplest tools to ensure maximum privacy:
- ✅ **Lightweight Framework:** Our website is constructed on a minimal framework that has been thoroughly audited to eliminate hidden tracking or logging.  
- ✅ **Anonymous Usage Data:** We collect a small amount of anonymous data, such as page views, device type, and language settings, to understand how users interact with our site. This data is aggregated and does not include any personal information that could identify individual users. You can view these statistics on [GoatCounter](https://beginnerprivacy.goatcounter.com).

### Have Questions?
If you have questions about our privacy practices or need to verify any of our claims, our entire website's code is open source and available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/BeginnerPrivacy). We encourage you to inspect it yourself or have a trusted technical advisor review it.
