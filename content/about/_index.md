Welcome to Beginner Privacy! 

In today’s digital world, protecting personal data can feel overwhelming. Our mission is to simplify online privacy for everyone—beginners to experts.

### What We Offer
Clear guides on privacy basics, advanced tools, and actionable steps to secure your online presence. Learn to safeguard social media, choose private software, or master encryption.

### Our Inspiration
Inspired by platforms like PrivacyTools and PrivacyGuides, we take a distinct, non-tool-centric approach. Instead of overwhelming beginners with complex software or systems, we focus on foundational knowledge and practical habits to build privacy first. Tools come later—once you’ve mastered the basics.

### Find Us Here
While Beginner Privacy has accounts on various social media platforms to reach new users. This is not an endorsement of these platforms, and we generally discourage their use.
