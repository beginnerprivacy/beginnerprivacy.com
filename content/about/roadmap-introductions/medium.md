The Medium Roadmap builds upon the foundational knowledge established in the Basic Roadmap, guiding you toward more advanced practices for enhancing your online security and privacy. This section introduces tools and strategies that empower you to take greater control over your digital footprint and safeguard your personal information.

In this roadmap, you will learn about the benefits of switching to Linux, an operating system known for its security and privacy features. You will also explore the world of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which offers alternatives to proprietary applications that may compromise your privacy.

Finally, you will be introduced to the concept of Operational Security (OpSec), which focuses on protecting your sensitive information and minimizing risks in your online activities.

As you progress through this roadmap, we recommend taking your time to implement these practices gradually. This will allow you to adapt to new tools and concepts while reinforcing your understanding of online security.
