The Advanced Roadmap is for those ready to make a significant lifestyle change in their approach to online security and privacy. This section emphasizes the importance of adopting a comprehensive mindset where privacy is prioritized over convenience.
<br><br>
You will learn about secure operating systems like Qubes OS and also about Tor and I2P. These tools enhance your anonymity but require a commitment to avoiding proprietary software and embracing free and open-source alternatives. Additionally, you will explore self-hosting your own services, because the only person you can truly trust is yourself—everyone else poses a potential threat.

Additionally, you will explore cryptocurrency, including secure acquisition and management practices, and the critical importance of encrypting your data to protect your communications and files. Operational Security (OpSec) will also be a key focus, as it is essential for minimizing risks in your online activities.
<br><br>

**Expected Time to Complete:** 1 month for completing the roadmap, but you must maintain good OpSec and continuously adapt your practices; it’s not simply about installing tools and operating systems and then being done.
