### Progress Update
- **Big UI/UX Improvements**: Beginner Privacy got the much-needed UI and UX improvements, so it looks a lot cleaner and more modern on all screen sizes now.
- **Privacy News Page**: A news page was launched with great successâ€”it runs on its own and fetches the latest data breaches, security, and privacy news.
- **Community Development**: We hit our goal with over 50 members on SimpleX, but it's still pretty quiet in the group chat, so we'll focus more on engaging folks there. We also picked up a couple of new followers on social media, and we'll post content more regularly.

### Next Steps
**1. Contributors**
- We're still looking to get some contributors to help with improving docs, articles, feature requests, and bug reports on the site.

**2. Spreading The Word**
- Keep spreading the word about privacy and why people should care about it, and let the privacy community know Beginner Privacy exists.

**3. Beginner Privacy+**
- We'll discuss and plan a premium subscription for Beginner Privacy in Q4, though it won't be the top priority.

### Finances  
- **Current Costs**:
  - Website: Free (Hosted with GitHub Pages)
  - Domain: $15.99/year
- **Cost Strategy**: We'll keep expenses minimal, sticking to only the essential stuff.

### Closing Notes  
Growth will be gradual, with a focus on sustainability. We'll share updates on community progress and spreading the word in Q4.
