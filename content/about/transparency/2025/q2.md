### Progress Update
- **Core Systems Complete**: The foundational work for Beginner Privacy is now in place.  
- **Workflow Established**: Basic processes are functional and ready for expansion.  

### Next Steps  
**1. Team Expansion**  
- Recruiting **2-3 admins/maintainers** to assist with operations.  

**2. Community Development**  
- **Self-Hosted Forum**: A Discourse forum will be set up on a VPS to foster discussions.  
- **Timeline**: Implementation will take time due to technical setup and testing.  

**3. Fiscal Hosting**  
- Applying for a fiscal host (e.g., Open Collective) to manage donations and sponsorships transparently.  

### Finances  
- **Current Costs**:
  - Website: Free (Hosted with GitHub Pages)
  - Domain: $15.99/year.  
  - Upcoming VPS: ~$10/month (for forum hosting + transactional email server).  
- **Cost Strategy**: Expenses will remain minimal, focusing only on essential services.  

### Closing Notes  
Growth will be gradual, with a focus on sustainability. Updates on forum progress and fiscal hosting will follow in Q3.
