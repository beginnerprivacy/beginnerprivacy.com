Did you know that every time you search online, you’re handing over clues about your life? Your searches can reveal your interests, habits, and even where you are. A private browser alone isn’t enough to protect you—you also need a privacy-focused search engine. The good news? Switching is quick and simple, and it’s a small step that can make a big difference.

### How Does a Search Engine Work?
Search engines power the internet, but there’s more to them than meets the eye.

**1. Crawlers Scout the Web**  
Bots, often called "crawlers" or "spiders," act like digital librarians. They roam the internet, scanning and cataloging websites to keep track of what’s out there.

**2. Indexing the Internet**  
Once crawled, pages are stored in a massive database known as the "index"—think of it as a giant card catalog for the web.

**3. Matching Your Query**  
When you type a search, the engine digs through its index to find pages matching your keywords. It then ranks them based on relevance, popularity, and other factors.

But here’s the catch: traditional search engines like Google don’t stop there. They log your queries, IP address, and device details to build a profile about you. Search for “best coffee shops near me,” and they might show you local ads—then use that data to pitch you coffee makers or travel deals later. This tracking can feel intrusive and puts your privacy at risk. Privacy-focused search engines skip this step, keeping your searches anonymous.
