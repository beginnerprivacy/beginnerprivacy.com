Protecting your personal data can feel overwhelming. Our mission is to simplify online privacy for everyone, from beginners to experts. We prioritize foundational knowledge and practical habits over complex tools, ensuring you build a strong privacy base before diving into advanced software.

<br>

Beginner Privacy is completely free and open source, thanks to our [contributors and supporters](/about/contributors). Learn how you can support us [here](/about/donate).

### What We Offer
Here’s what we offer at Beginner Privacy to help you protect your online privacy:
- **Roadmap**: Learn privacy and security step-by-step, from zero to expert.  
- **Checklists**: Quick, practical steps for specific needs, like our protester safety checklist.  
- **News**: Stay updated with the latest privacy and security updates.
- **Community**: Join our active [community](/about/join-simplex-group) to share tips, ask questions, and connect with others.

### Languages
Beginner Privacy is currently available in three languages:
- English  
- Spanish  
- Chinese (Simplified)

These are the three [most widely spoken languages in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers#Ethnologue_(2025)), which is why we chose to support them. Our goal is to make the site as accessible as possible while still keeping maintenance manageable — that's also why we don't currently offer additional languages.

#### Want the site in another language?  
No problem! If you're using **Brave** or **Firefox**, you can take advantage of their excellent built-in translation features:
- **Brave**: Click the menu (⋮) → **Translate this page**

- **Firefox**: Click the menu (☰) → **Translate Page** (or right-click anywhere on the page → **Translate Page**)

### Find Us Here
Beginner Privacy has accounts on various social media platforms to reach new people. However, it is not an endorsement of these platforms, and we generally discourage their use.
