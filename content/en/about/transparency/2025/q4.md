### Progress Update
- **Content Enhancements:** We enhanced the quality of our existing articles and revised the roadmap steps to offer clearer guidance for beginners. For advanced users, we now direct them to a more specialized resource, *The OpSec Bible*, which provides more technical tutorials.

- **The OpSec Bible Mirror:** Launched a clearnet mirror at [bible.beginnerprivacy.com](https://bible.beginnerprivacy.com). It auto-updates weekly for easy access on the clearnet.

- **Community Engagement:** SimpleX group now has 70+ members, though activity is low—we'll boost it with more interactions and updates. Social media followers are growing modestly; we'll post privacy tips more consistently to build engagement.

- **GoatCounter Statistics:** We removed our website statistics. It provided little value, and we wanted to stay true to our no-tracking principles — even though GoatCounter is very privacy-friendly.

### Next Steps
1. **Expand Translations:** Beginner Privacy is currently available in English, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese. Introducing i18n for easier management and exploring automated tools (e.g., Argos Translate). 
    - Goal: Add French, German, Russian, Arabic, and Hindi—ensuring accurate, culturally relevant translations for global reach.

2. **Increase Awareness:** Aim for 100+ daily unique visitors by educating broader audiences on digital privacy. Strategies:
    - Boosting social media presence with more frequent and engaging posts.
    - Increasing participation in privacy-focused forums and discussions to build credibility and connect with a larger community.
    - Making the roadmap more gamified and actionable

3. **Achieve Financial Sustainability:** Scrapped planned premium subscription to keep everything 100% free and accessible. Instead we want to when Beginner Privacy has grown big enough:
    - Develop ethical privacy products and services that align with our values e.g., accepting no-KYC cryptocurrency payments.

### Finances
- **Current Costs** 
  - Website Hosting: Free (GitHub Pages)
  - Domain: $15.99/year

- **Strategy**: Maintain low overhead with free/open-source tools and volunteer support. Scale investments as traffic and monetization grow.

### Closing Notes
We're building Beginner Privacy sustainably and ethically. In Q4 2025, priorities include:
- Enhancing content and engagement
- Expanding languages for global access
- Growing traffic and community
- Pursuing privacy-respecting monetization to remain independent
