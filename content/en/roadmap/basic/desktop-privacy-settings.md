Our desktops collect vast amounts of data about us, and it’s crucial to take control and limit what they know. Here are some settings you can change to improve your privacy.

### Which Operating System Is More Private? Windows, Linux, or macOS
Linux is the clear winner when it comes to privacy. While Windows and macOS dominate the market—mainly due to user familiarity (Windows is pre-installed on most new computers) and strong ecosystem integration—they ultimately prioritize corporate interests over user privacy. In contrast, Linux distributions are open-source and community-driven, giving users full control over their data and the entire system.
