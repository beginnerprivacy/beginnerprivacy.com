Are you tired of endless spam emails, robocalls, or discovering your personal data was sold to shady data brokers? Every time you hand over your real name, email, or phone number to a random app or website, you’re gambling with your privacy. To avoid this you'll have to provide fake information.

### When Not to Use Fake Information
It's important to know when you should use fake information and when you should not, as it can quickly backfire.
- **Long Term Use Accounts:** Don't use a temporary email when signing up for accounts that you plan to use more than 1 time.
- **Buying Things Online:** You should provide a real address if you're getting your package delivered to your house. If you are picking up a package at a post office, you should consider using your real name, as they sometime require you to show ID.
- **Other:** Please consider the following two things each time before you provide fake information:
    - Is this service or account important to my life?
    - Will I get in trouble if I provide fake information?
 
### Fake Information
Not every website or form deserves your honesty. For non-critical accounts, use fabricated details:
- **Fake names:** Use a pseudonym like “Alex Smith” instead of your real name.
- **Fake birthdays:** Pick a random date (e.g., January 1, 1985).
- **Fake addresses:** Use a random address (e.g., a library or coffee shop).

### Temporary Email
Why risk getting spammed on your primary email? Use a **burner email** for one-time signups or sketchy downloads.

For a more permanent solution, we recommend using an email aliasing service. This allows you to provide an alias instead of your actual email address, ensuring your real email remains a secret. Any messages sent to the alias will be automatically forwarded to your real email.

### Temporary Phone Number
The same goes for phone numbers. You don't have to give your real phone number for temporary accounts.

  Remember that all the messages are visible to the public.

### Delete Old Accounts
You should always consider deleting accounts you don't use anymore because they leave you vulnerable to data breaches. The more accounts you have, the more vulnerable you are, especially as [data breaches happen often nowadays](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites).

<br>

It's a good practice to regularly check your password manager for accounts you no longer use or to look through your email for messages from websites you haven't visited in a while. Before creating a new account on a platform, ask yourself: "Do I really need to make an account?"

<br>

Be aware that websites sometimes make it difficult to delete your account on purpose. However, you can use [Just Delete Me](https://justdeleteme.xyz/) to find instructions on how to delete your accounts. If you are living in Europe, remember that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives you the right to request the deletion of your personal data from companies. Make sure to exercise this right when necessary.
