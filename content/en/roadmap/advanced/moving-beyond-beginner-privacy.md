Congratulations! You've reached the end of the Beginner Privacy roadmap. You've dipped your toes into the essentials of privacy, security, and anonymity, and now you're ready for the next step.

### Why Move Beyond Beginner Privacy?
Privacy is binary: you either have it, or you don’t. While using free and open-source software (FOSS) apps is a great start, running them on a closed-source operating system like Windows—even with telemetry disabled—undermines your efforts. Closed-source systems obscure what’s happening in the background, making true privacy impossible.

<br>

The Beginner Privacy roadmap introduced you to foundational concepts and basic security practices, but achieving robust privacy, security, and anonymity requires more advanced measures. To help you take this leap, we’re excited to introduce a powerful resource and community.

### Introducing The OpSec Bible
Created by the [Nowhere community](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/), *The OpSec Bible* offers in-depth guides to achieve true privacy, security, anonymity, and deniability. These guides are technical and best suited for advanced users ready to dive deeper into operational security (OpSec).

#### Where to Access It
