### What is Linux?
Linux is a free, open-source operating system kernel created in 1991 by Finnish student Linus Torvalds. Frustrated with expensive commercial Unix and the limitations of MINIX, Torvalds started building his own Unix-like kernel as a hobby project on his PC.

<br>

Technically, Linux is just the kernel—the core software that manages hardware (CPU, memory, storage, devices) and runs programs. A full operating system also needs tools, libraries, and a user interface. The GNU Project (launched by Richard Stallman in 1983) had already created most of these components, but was missing a kernel. When Torvalds released his kernel under a free license, it combined with GNU’s tools to form a complete OS—commonly called Linux (though the more precise name is GNU/Linux).

<br>

Today "Linux" refers to the huge family of operating systems built around this kernel. Hundreds of distributions ("distros") exist, from beginner-friendly ones like Ubuntu and Linux Mint to server-focused, embedded, and specialized versions.

### Why Switch to Linux? 
Linux isn’t just for tech wizards—it’s a powerful, open-source operating system that prioritizes **privacy**, **customization**, and **stability**. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux doesn’t track your activity or force you into proprietary ecosystems. It’s free to use, modify, and share, backed by a global community of developers. Whether you’re a privacy-conscious user, a tinkerer, or someone tired of bloated software, Linux offers a refreshing alternative.

But you might still want to be able to play your favorite games. The good news is that you can! Many popular games are now available on Linux, and with tools like Proton, you can enjoy a wide range of games that were once exclusive to Windows. Additionally, if you need to run applications build only for Windows, [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) allows you to do that on Linux as well. If you want to learn more about playing your favorite games on Linux, read our article [here](/articles/game-on-a-beginners-guide-to-linux-gaming).

### Choosing Your Linux Distribution
With hundreds of distributions (or “distros”) available, picking the right one can feel overwhelming. Here’s a quick breakdown:
- **Debian-based distros** (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint) are ideal for beginners due to their stability and extensive software libraries.
- **Arch-based distros** (e.g., Manjaro) cater to users who want bleeding-edge software and deeper customization.
- **Fedora** or **openSUSE** strike a balance between innovation and reliability.

For most newcomers, we recommend **Debian**—the rock-solid foundation for many popular distros, as you can see on the chart below. Once you’ve chosen a distro, decide on a desktop environment:
- **GNOME**: Sleek, modern, and intuitive (similar to macOS).
- **KDE Plasma**: Highly customizable with a Windows-like feel.
- **XFCE** or **LXQt**: Lightweight options for older hardware.

### Getting Comfortable with Linux
Before wiping your hard drive, **test Linux risk-free in a virtual machine (VM)**. Tools like **VirtualBox** let you run Linux alongside your current OS. Here’s how:
1. Download a Linux ISO (e.g., Debian or Ubuntu).
2. Install VirtualBox and create a new VM, allocating resources like RAM and storage.
3. Boot the VM from the ISO and install it through the "Graphical Install" option.

### Making the Switch: What to Expect
Many fear Linux is all about typing commands in a terminal. While the terminal is powerful, **modern distros offer user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)** for everyday tasks like browsing, editing files, or installing software.

#### Dual Booting: The Best of Both Worlds
Need Windows or macOS for specific apps or work? **Dual booting** lets you keep both Operating Systems on one machine.
- **Single-drive setup**: Partition your drive to allocate space for Linux.
- **Multi-drive setup**: Install Linux on a separate drive for easier management.

  **Back up your data first!** Partitioning carries risks, and mistakes can lead to data loss.

### Preparing for Installation
Before installing Linux, gather these essentials:
- A **USB drive (8GB+ recommended)** for the installer.
- An **external drive** to back up critical files.

### Installing Debian: Step-by-Step Guide
#### Step 1: Download the Correct Debian ISO
Visit [Debian’s download page](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst) and select under the "Small CDs or USB sticks" header:
- **amd64**: For most 64-bit Intel/AMD systems.
- **arm64**: For newer ARM-based devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4).
- **i386**: For older 32-bit machines (rare today).

#### Step 2: Create a Bootable USB
**For Windows**
1. Install **Rufus** ([download here](https://rufus.ie)).
2. Plug in your USB drive and open Rufus.
3. Select the Debian ISO you downloaded.
4. Make sure the partition scheme is set to **MBR** and the target system is **BIOS or UEFI**.
5. Click **Start** and wait for the process to complete.

**For macOS**
1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Use the `diskutil` command to list your drives:
   ```bash
   diskutil list
   ```
3. Unmount the USB drive (replace `diskN` with your USB drive number):
   ```bash
   diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN
   ```
4. Use the `dd` command to create the bootable USB (replace `path/to/debian.iso` and `diskN` accordingly):
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=path/to/debian.iso of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m
   ```
5. Wait for the process to complete, then eject the USB drive:
   ```bash
   diskutil eject /dev/diskN
   ```

#### Step 3: Boot from the USB
1. Restart your computer and press the **BIOS/UEFI key** (commonly F2, F12, Del, or Esc).
2. In the boot menu, prioritize the USB drive.
3. Save changes and exit to launch the Debian installer.

#### Step 4: Install Debian
1. Select **Graphical Install** for a guided setup.
2. Follow prompts for language, location, and user account creation.
3. When it prompts you about **Partitioning** you have the following options:
- **Guided - use entire disk**:
  Erases the entire disk and installs Debian as the sole operating system. Ideal for new users or dedicated Linux setups.

- **Guided - use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM**:
  Installs Debian as the sole OS while enabling full-disk encryption via LVM (Logical Volume Manager). Perfect for securing sensitive data.

- **Manual**:
  For advanced users: Create, resize, or retain partitions (e.g., dual-boot with Windows). Requires familiarity with disk layouts.
4. When it prompts you about **Software Selection**: Choose the desktop environment you want (GNOME or KDE Plasma) and optional tools (e.g., SSH server, print server).
5. Complete the installation and reboot.
