### What is Threat Intelligence?
Threat intelligence is the collection and analysis of information regarding current and emerging threats that can impact your digital security. This encompasses knowledge about various cyber threats, including malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches. The primary aim of threat intelligence is to provide individuals with insights that help them understand the risks they face online and take appropriate measures to protect themselves.

#### 1. Set Up an RSS Feed
