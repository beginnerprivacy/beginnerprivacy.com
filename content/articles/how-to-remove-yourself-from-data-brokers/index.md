Data brokers collect and compile vast amounts of personal information about you from a variety of sources to create detailed profiles. These profiles can be used for targeted marketing, advertising, and may even [affect your credit or insurance rates](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/17/629441555/health-insurers-are-vacuuming-up-details-about-you-and-it-could-raise-your-rates)‚Äîoften without your direct knowledge or consent.

### Removing Yourself From Data Brokers
Regaining control over your personal data involves a few key steps, from identifying where your data lives to submitting removal requests. Here‚Äôs how to approach it:

#### 1. Identify Where Your Information is Stored
Begin by discovering which data brokers have your personal information. You can explore two methods to find your data across these brokers:

##### Manual Search
Visit each data broker‚Äôs website to locate their opt-out or privacy page. Many of these sites offer searchable databases that allow you to verify whether your information is listed.

We recommend prioritizing your search with the data brokers marked with a üíê (crucial) or ‚ò† (high priority) in the [Big Ass Data Broker Opt-Out List](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List).

##### Automated Tools
There are privacy-focused services and tools that scan multiple data brokers simultaneously for your personal information. These can streamline the discovery process, helping you identify where your data is listed quickly and efficiently.

Using a combination of manual checks and automated services ensures a thorough search.

#### 2. Submit Removal Requests
Once you know which brokers hold your data, submit opt-out requests to have your information removed. There are several ways to do this:

##### Manual Submission (Recommended) 
Follow each broker‚Äôs instructions on their website to request removal. This often includes filling out opt-out forms and verifying your identity to prevent fraudulent requests.

We suggest starting with the data brokers that have your information and are marked with a üíê (crucial) or ‚ò† (high priority) in the [Big Ass Data Broker Opt-Out List](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List).

##### Automated Services
Some privacy companies offer tools that can automatically submit removal requests to multiple data brokers, saving you time and ensuring thoroughness. However, be careful‚Äîthese services can sometimes do more harm than good. They may share all the information you provide with many brokers, including sensitive details that were previously unknown.

Patience is key, as processing times can vary from days to several weeks.

#### 3. Regularly Monitor and Remove Yourself
Data brokers frequently update their databases, so your information may reappear over time. Make it a habit to:
- Periodically search your name and related details online.
- Revisit data brokers‚Äô opt-out pages.
- Resubmit removal requests when necessary.
