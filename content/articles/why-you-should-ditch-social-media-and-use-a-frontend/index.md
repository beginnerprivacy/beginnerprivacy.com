Social media platforms are major data collectors that gather a lot of information about you. While many people may want to leave social media behind, it's not always practical or appealing. Instead, we recommend using a frontend, which allows you to engage with content and connect with others while protecting your privacy.

### What is a Frontend?
A frontend is an interface that lets you interact with online services, including social media, without being tracked. It can be a website or an app designed for easy use, helping you access content and connect with others while protecting your privacy.

### Why Use a Frontend?
Choosing a frontend over social media has several benefits:
- **Less Data Collection:** Frontends limit the personal information they gather, helping protect your privacy.

- **Customizable Experience:** You can often personalize how you interact with content, choosing the features that matter most to you.

- **Focused Engagement:** Frontends help you connect with content that truly interests you, free from the distractions of social media.

- **Same Content:** Instead of switching to a less popular platform like Odysee, you can use a frontend to access the same YouTube videos you enjoy, all while protecting your privacy.
