Linux gaming has seen significant advancements in recent years. If you’ve considered switching to Linux but were concerned about the availability of your favorite games, you’re not alone. This concern has been common, but the reality is that many popular games are now accessible on Linux.

### The Changing Landscape of Linux Gaming
Historically, Linux was not a popular choice for gamers due to a limited selection of games and compatibility issues. However, the situation has improved considerably. With the rise of indie game development and increased support from major platforms, Linux is becoming a more viable option for gamers.

### Steam's Proton: A Key Development
One of the most important tools for Linux gaming is [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton), a compatibility layer developed by Valve. Proton allows many Windows-exclusive games to run on Linux through the Steam client. By utilizing Wine and other technologies, Proton simplifies the process of playing Windows games on Linux.

With Proton, users can install and play a wide range of games without needing to set up complex configurations or dual-boot systems. This has opened the door for many gamers who previously felt limited by their operating system.

### Using ProtonDB for Compatibility Checks
Before diving into a new game, it’s helpful to check [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com), a community-driven database that provides information on how well various games run under Proton. Users share their experiences, performance reports, and any necessary tweaks, making it easier to determine which games are worth trying on Linux.

### Lutris: A Comprehensive Game Manager
In addition to Proton, there’s [Lutris](https://lutris.net/), an open-source game manager that supports a variety of game sources. Lutris allows users to manage native Linux games, Windows games through Wine, and even emulators for classic consoles. It simplifies the installation process with scripts that automate setup, making it accessible for users of all skill levels.
