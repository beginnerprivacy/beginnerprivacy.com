Did you know that the most [commonly used password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords) is "123456"? This highlights the importance of using strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. In this post, we'll go over the best practices for generating and storing strong passwords.

### Common Password Security Mistakes:
- Using personal information in your passwords
- Using the same password for multiple accounts
- Storing passwords in plaintext or in easily accessible locations

### How Do I Make Strong Passwords?
A strong password is a password that is difficult to guess or crack. It should be completely random and at least 16 characters long (preferably longer) and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

To get a strong password you can use a free online password generator:
- [BitWarden Password Generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/#password-generator)

### Storing Passwords Securely
Password managers are great to use because they allow you to store long and complex passwords, and then simply copy and paste them when needed. It works by setting a master password, which is used to encrypt all of your other passwords. This means that all of your passwords are stored securely and can only be accessed with the master password.

Recommended password managers:
