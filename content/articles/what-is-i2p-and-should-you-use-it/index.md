### What Is I2P?
Launched in 2003 by privacy advocates, the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an open-source network for anonymous, censorship-resistant communication. It's not for public web browsing like Tor; instead, it builds a hidden overlay for P2P services like eepsites, file sharing, chats, and emailâ€”all encrypted and internal.

I2P uses garlic routing: messages are bundled into "garlics" with multiple "cloves" (your data mixed with others'), making traffic analysis tough. This tops Tor's onion layers by adding misdirection. Data travels via unidirectional tunnels with end-to-end encryption, keys changing per hop. Fully decentralized, it runs on volunteer routers with no central control, resisting shutdowns and spying.

### Should You Use I2P?
I2P excels for private P2P but isn't beginner-friendly. Consider this:

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
|------|------|
| Excellent anonymity for internal activities like torrenting (via I2PSnark) without exit nodes. | Slower speeds from heavy encryption and routing. |
| Resists surveillance through data mixing and no single failure point. | Smaller user base (30k-60k routers) means less content and reliability. |
| Active community with integrations for IRC and email within the network. | Steeper setup: learn concepts like destinations; no easy browser bundle. |

Go for I2P if you need anonymous internal networking and can handle the setup. For clearnet access, use Tor or VPNs.

### Installing I2P
Download I2P from the [official website](https://geti2p.net/en/download) remember to verify signatures.

**Prerequisites:** [Java JRE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (except Windows Easy Bundle).

**Windows:** Easy Bundle (Java-free) from geti2p.net/nsis, or standard installer post-Java.

**macOS:** Run .jar installer via double-click or terminal: `java -jar i2pinstall_2.10.0.jar`.

**Linux:** Run .jar installer via the terminal: `java -jar i2pinstall_2.10.0.jar`.

**Android:** APK from site or F-Droid (Android 4.0+, 512MB RAM); uninstall old versions.

**Post-Install:** Access console at `http://127.0.0.1:7657/` for config. Start low-bandwidth. Integrate apps like I2PSnark.
