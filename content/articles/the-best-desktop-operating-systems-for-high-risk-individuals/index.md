Today, high-risk individuals—such as journalists, activists, and whistleblowers—face significant threats to their privacy and security. Traditional operating systems like Windows, macOS, and standard Linux distributions often lack the robust security features necessary to protect sensitive information from sophisticated cyber threats and surveillance. These mainstream OS options are typically designed for convenience and usability, which can inadvertently expose users to vulnerabilities.

### Recommended Desktop OS for High-Risk Individuals
#### Qubes OS
Qubes OS is a security-focused operating system that uses virtualization to create isolated environments for different applications. Each application runs in its own virtual machine, ensuring that a compromise in one does not affect the others. **Qubes OS is for maximum security and privacy; people like Edward Snowden use it.**

#### Tails
Tails is a live operating system designed for anonymity and privacy. It runs from a USB stick or DVD, leaving no trace on the host computer. By routing all internet traffic through the Tor network, **Tails is perfect for someone on the run or for those who don't want to carry around a laptop.**

#### Whonix
Whonix is a privacy-centric operating system that emphasizes anonymity through the use of Tor. It consists of two virtual machines: one for running applications and another for routing traffic through Tor. **Whonix is for people who just want to be anonymous without the isolation in Qubes OS.**
