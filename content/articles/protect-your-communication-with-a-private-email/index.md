Popular email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo leave you vulnerable.

### The Importance of Email Privacy
Popular email providers such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo engage in practices that can compromise your privacy, such as selling your data to third parties, scanning your inbox for targeted advertising, and leaving you vulnerable to data breaches.

### What A Privacy Focused Email Does
- **Anonymous Sign-Up:** You can register without giving away personal info, keeping your identity unknown.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Your emails are secured so only you and the person you're sending to can read them. The email provider can't peek.
- **Open Source Transparency:** They share their source code publicly, so anyone can check if they're really secure and private.
