Popular email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo can leave you vulnerable to various privacy risks and security threats, as their business models are heavily dependent on the collection and monetization of user data.

### The Importance of Email Privacy
Using mainstream email services often means compromising your privacy. Providers like Gmail and Yahoo engage in practices that can expose your personal information, such as:
- **Data Monetization:** These companies frequently sell your data to advertisers, which can lead to targeted ads based on your email content and behavior.
- **Invasive Scanning:** Your inbox may be scanned for keywords to serve personalized ads, raising concerns about who has access to your private conversations.
- **Data Breaches:** High-profile breaches have shown that these services can be vulnerable, putting your sensitive information at risk.
- **Lack of Encryption:** Most mainstream providers do not offer end-to-end encryption by default, meaning your emails could be accessed by the provider or intercepted by others.

### What a Privacy Focused Email Does
- **Anonymous Sign-Up:** You can register without giving away personal info, keeping your identity unknown.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Your emails are secured so only you and the person you're sending to can read them. The email provider can't peek.
- **Open Source Transparency:** They share their source code publicly, so anyone can check if they're really secure and private.
