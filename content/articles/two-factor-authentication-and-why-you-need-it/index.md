**Imagine this:** You’ve used the same password for years. Then, an email says someone logged into your bank account from another country.

Passwords alone aren’t enough. Hackers steal them via phishing, leaks, or brute force attacks. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds a second layer to stop them.

### How Does 2FA Work?
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) secures your account by requiring two distinct forms of verification: something you know (your password) and something you have or are (a second factor). Here’s how it works step-by-step:

1. **You Enter Your Password**: When you log in, you type your usual password. This is the first factor, proving you know the account credentials. The system checks if it matches the stored, encrypted password.
   
2. **The System Requests a Second Factor**: If the password is correct, the service prompts for a second piece of proof to confirm it’s really you. This second factor is independent of your password and uses a different method to verify your identity. Common types include:
   - **One-Time Code**: A temporary, unique code (usually 6-8 digits) generated by an authenticator app, sent via SMS, or emailed. For apps, the code is created using a shared secret key (set up during 2FA enrollment, often via a QR code) and a time-based algorithm (TOTP, or Time-Based One-Time Password). The code refreshes every 30 seconds, making it useless to hackers after a short window.
   - **Biometrics**: A fingerprint, face scan, or other unique physical trait. The device scans your biometric data, encrypts it, and compares it to a stored template. This only works on devices you’ve registered, ensuring the data stays local and secure.
   - **Physical Security Key**: A device like a YubiKey that you plug into your computer or tap on your phone. When prompted, the key uses cryptographic protocols (like FIDO2 or U2F) to confirm your identity with a unique digital signature, proving you possess the physical device.

3. **Verification and Access**: The service checks the second factor against its records. For example, it confirms the one-time code matches the expected TOTP for that moment or validates the security key’s signature. If both the password and second factor are correct, you’re granted access. If either fails, the login is blocked, keeping hackers out even if they have your password.

This dual-check process makes 2FA highly effective because stealing your password isn’t enough—hackers also need access to your second factor, which is much harder to obtain.

### Types of 2FA: Which Should You Use?
Not all 2FA methods are equally secure.

- **Security Keys:** Best, physical devices (like YubiKey) that plug into your phone or computer.

- **Authenticator Apps:** Great, these apps allow you to scan a QR code and then generate time-sensitive codes completely offline.

- **SMS / Email Codes:** Convenient, but hackers can intercept these via SIM-swapping or phishing.

- **Biometrics:** Good, fingerprint or face scans are secure but only work on devices you own.

### How to Enable 2FA on Your Accounts
Most platforms make it easy. Here’s how to do it on some platforms:
- **Google:** Security → 2-Step Verification → Get Started.
- **Apple ID:** Settings → [Your Name] → Password & Security.
- **Facebook:** Settings → Security and Login → Two-Factor Authentication.
- **Other:** Usually the same steps as the platforms above.

### Recommended Authenticator Apps
Here are the authenticator apps we recommend for storing your 2FA codes. Many [password managers](/articles/how-to-create-strong-passwords-and-store-them-securely/#storing-passwords-securely) can also store 2FA codes.
