**Imagine this:** You’ve used the same password for years. Then, an email says someone logged into your bank account from another country.

Passwords alone aren’t enough. Hackers steal them via phishing, leaks, or brute forcing attacks. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds a second layer to stop them.

### How Does 2FA Work?
1. Enter your password.
2. Verify with a second factor
    - A one-time code (app / SMS / email).
    - Biometrics (fingerprint / face scan).
    - A physical security key.

Even with your password, hackers can’t access your account without the second factor.

### Types of 2FA: Which Should You Use?
Not all 2FA methods are equally secure.

**Security Keys:** Best, physical devices (like YubiKey) that plug into your phone or computer.

**Authenticator Apps:** Great, these apps allow you to scan a QR code and then generate time-sensitive codes completely offline.

**SMS / Email Codes:** Convenient, but hackers can intercept these via SIM-swapping or phishing.

**Biometrics:** Good, fingerprint or face scans are secure but only work on devices you own.

### How to Enable 2FA on Your Accounts
Most platforms make it easy. Here’s how to do it on some platforms:
- **Google:** Security → 2-Step Verification → Get Started.
- **Apple ID:** Settings → [Your Name] → Password & Security.
- **Facebook:** Settings → Security and Login → Two-Factor Authentication.
- **Other:** Usually the same steps as the platforms above.

### Recommended Authenticator Apps
Here are the authenticator apps we recommend for storing your 2FA codes. Many [password managers](https://beginnerprivacy.com/articles/how-to-create-strong-passwords-and-store-them-securely/#storing-passwords-securely) can also store 2FA codes.
