You've probably encountered countless VPN ads on platforms like YouTube. But how do they actually work, and more importantly, should you use one?

### How Does a VPN Work?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure connection between your device and the internet by routing your traffic through a private server. This process encrypts your data, making it impossible for your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to see your online activities.

### What Does a VPN Protect You From?
While a VPN is effective at hiding your IP address, accessing geo-restricted content, and preventing ISP surveillance, it does not protect you from hackers, phishing emails, or other threats. Authorities can still request information from the VPN company, which may have a no-logging policy regarding your internet activity but could still retain personal information like your email, phone number, and real name.

### How to Choose a Good VPN
When searching for a reliable VPN, trustworthiness is crucial since the service will have access to your online activities. Here are key factors to consider when evaluating a VPN:
- **Open Source:** Look for VPNs with open-source code, allowing for transparency and community audits.
- **Minimal Personal Information Required:** Choose services that donâ€™t require sensitive information like your name, phone number, or email.
- **Strict No-Logging Policy:** Ensure the VPN has a verified no-logging policy, meaning they do not store your browsing history.
- **Strong Encryption Protocols:** Opt for VPNs that use modern encryption standards, such as OpenVPN or WireGuard, to protect your data.
