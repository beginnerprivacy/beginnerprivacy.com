Creating a threat model is an important step in your journey toward better privacy and security. It’s all about figuring out who or what you need to protect yourself from and what you’re willing to do to keep your information safe. But here’s the catch: the more privacy and security you want, the more inconvenient things can get. You might find yourself juggling extra steps, using complex tools, or changing your habits. It’s a balancing act—finding the right mix of security that keeps you safe without making your life too complicated.

### Developing Your Threat Model
To create a threat model, you can take our threat model assessment.

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "How sensitive is your typical online activity?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "Basic web browsing (e.g., reading news, shopping)", "score": 1},
        {"text": "Some personal communications (e.g., social media, emails)", "score": 2},
        {"text": "Handling sensitive work documents (e.g., client data, contracts)", "score": 3},
        {"text": "Activism or whistleblowing (e.g., sharing sensitive information)", "score": 4}
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your biggest privacy concern?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "Targeted ads", "score": 1},
        {"text": "Mass surveillance", "score": 2},
        {"text": "Having a digital footprint", "score": 3},
        {"text": "Being targeted by malicious actors", "score": 4}
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "What lengths are you willing to go to protect your privacy?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "I prefer convenience over security", "score": 1},
        {"text": "I'll make some effort, but not too much", "score": 2},
        {"text": "I'm willing to sacrifice a decent amount of convenience for better security and privacy", "score": 3},
        {"text": "I’m ready to invest heavily in security and change my lifestyle", "score": 4}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "resultText": {
    "casual": "Casual User: Basic privacy protections recommended",
    "privacyConscious": "Privacy-Conscious: Medium-level security measures advised",
    "advanced": "Advanced User: Comprehensive security framework needed"
  }
}

You can also do it manually by asking yourself the following questions:

**1. What do I want to protect?**

Identify the assets that are most important to you. This could include personal data, financial information, intellectual property, or even your online reputation.

**2. Who do I want to protect it from?**

Consider the potential adversaries. Are you concerned about cybercriminals, government surveillance, insider threats, or even unintentional breaches by friends or family?

**3. How likely is it that I will need to protect it?**

Assess the likelihood of encountering these threats. Are you a high-profile individual, or do you engage in activities that might attract unwanted attention?

**4. How severe are the consequences if I fail?**

Evaluate the potential impact of a security breach. Would it result in financial loss, reputational damage, or legal repercussions? Understanding the stakes can help prioritize your efforts.

**5. What lengths am I willing to go to prevent potential consequences?**

Determine your comfort level with various security measures. Are you willing to invest in advanced security tools, adopt strict privacy practices, or change your online behavior?

### I have a threat model. Now what?
Now that you have your threat model, it’s time to decide how far you want to go on the Beginner Privacy roadmap. Here are a few profiles to help guide your choice:

**The Casual User:** If your main concern is simply hiding your personal information from big corporations and mass surveillance, the **Basic** roadmap is all you need.

**The Privacy-Conscious Individual:** If you want to take your privacy more seriously and go beyond the basics to shield yourself from potential threats, you should continue to the **Medium** roadmap after completing the **Basic** roadmap.

**The Activist or High-Risk Individual:** If you’re an activist, a journalist, or someone who is wanted by the government, or if you simply want to ensure the highest level of privacy, you should follow the **Advanced** roadmap after completing both the **Basic** and **Medium** roadmaps.

### Regularly Updating Your Threat Model
Your threat model isn’t a one-and-done task; it’s something that should evolve as your life and circumstances change. To keep it relevant, consider setting a schedule to review your threat model regularly. This is especially important after significant life events, such as starting a new job, moving to a different location, or making changes to your online presence.
