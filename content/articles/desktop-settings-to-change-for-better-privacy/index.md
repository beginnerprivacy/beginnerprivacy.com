The desktop collects all kinds of information about us. That’s why it’s important to take control and limit what it knows about us.

### Which Operating System Is More Private? Windows, Linux, or MacOS
Linux is the most privacy-respecting option. While Windows and MacOS dominate the market, they don’t prioritize user privacy as much as Linux (which is also open source).

### Privacy Settings
#### Linux
**Disable Telemetry** 
- Some distributions may send diagnostic data, usually off by default. You can search for how to disable it for your specific distribution.

#### Windows
**Restrict App Permissions** 
- Navigate to **Settings > Privacy & security**.
- Scroll down to the App permissions section and adjust the following settings:
    - Location: Turn off "Location services".
    - Camera: Turn off "Camera access".
    - Microphone: Turn off "Microphone access".

**Disable Telemetry** 
- Go to **Settings > Privacy & security > Diagnostics & feedback**.
- Disable "Send optional diagnostic data".
- Additionally, turn off:
    - "Improve inking and typing"
    - "Tailored experiences"
    -  "View diagnostic data"

**Disable Ad Tracking**
- Access **Settings > Privacy & security > General**.
- Turn off "Let apps show me personalized ads by using my advertising ID".

#### MacOS
**Restrict App Permissions** 
- Navigate to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab**. In the following categories, turn off access if you don’t want any apps to use it, or allow it only for specific apps:
    - Location Services
    - Contacts
    - Calendars
    - Photos
    - Microphone
    - Camera
    - Files 
    - Folders

**Disable Telemetry** 
- Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab > Analytics** and turn off "Share Mac Analytics" and "Share with App Developers".

**Disable Ad Tracking**
- Access **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab > Advertising** and check the box "Limit Ad Tracking".

**Disable Siri**
- Siri collects and sends a ton of information to Apple about you. Disable it by going to **System Preferences > Siri** and turn off "Enable Ask Siri".
