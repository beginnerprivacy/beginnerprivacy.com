The importance of secure communication cannot be overstated, and that's why you should ditch traditional SMS, as it puts your privacy at risk.

### Why You Should Ditch SMS
SMS, short for Short Message Service, was invented in 1984 and has seen little evolution since then. Here are some key reasons to move away from SMS:
- **Lack of Encryption:** SMS messages are not encrypted, meaning they can be intercepted and read by anyone, including telecom companies.
- **Data Profiling:** Telecom companies can profile users by analyzing their messages and logs, often selling this data to third parties without your consent.

### Getting Others To Use It
Transitioning to a secure communication method is only effective if your contacts are on board. Here are some strategies to encourage others to ditch SMS:
- **Educate Your Contacts:** Share information about the risks associated with SMS and the benefits of secure messaging apps.
- **Lead by Example:** Start using secure communication methods yourself and invite others to join you.
